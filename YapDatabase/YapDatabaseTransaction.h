/**
 * Welcome to YapDatabase!
 *
 * The project page has a wealth of documentation if you have any questions.
 * https://github.com/yaptv/YapDatabase
 *
 * If you're new to the project you may want to visit the wiki.
 * https://github.com/yaptv/YapDatabase/wiki
 * 
 * Transactions represent atomic access to a database.
 * There are two types of transactions:
 * - Read-Only transactions
 * - Read-Write transactions
 *
 * Once a transaction is started, all data access within the transaction from that point forward until completion
 * represents an atomic "snapshot" of the current state of the database. For example, if a read-write operation
 * occurs in parallel with a read-only transaction, the read-only transaction won't see the changes made by
 * the read-write operation. But once the read-write operation completes, all transactions started from that point
 * forward will see the changes.
 *
 * You first create and configure a YapDatabase instance.
 * Then you can spawn one or more connections to the database file.
 * Each connection allows you to execute transactions in a serial fashion.
 * For concurrent access, you can create multiple connections,
 * and execute transactions on each connection simulataneously.
 *
 * Concurrency is straight-forward. Here are the rules:
 *
 * - You can have multiple connections.
 * - Every connection is thread-safe.
 * - You can have multiple read-only transactions simultaneously without blocking.
 *   (Each simultaneous transaction would be going through a separate connection.)
 * - You can have multiple read-only transactions and a single read-write transaction simultaneously without blocking.
 *   (Each simultaneous transaction would be going through a separate connection.)
 * - There can only be a single transaction per connection at a time.
 *   (Transactions go through a per-connection serial queue.)
 * - There can only be a single read-write transaction at a time.
 *   (Read-write transactions go through a per-database serial queue.)

/**
 * A YapDatabaseReadTransaction encompasses a single read-only database transaction.

 *   This image gets changed. Thus the UI representation of the book needs to be updated to reflect the updated image.
 *   You realize that all your views are already listening for YapDatabaseModified notifications,
 *   so if you update the object in the database, all your views are already wired to update the UI appropriately.
 *   However, the actual object itself didn't change. So while there technically isn't any reason to

 *
 * And this is exactly what the touch methods were designed for.
 * It won't actually cause the object to get rewritten to disk.
 * However, it will mark the object as "updated" within the YapDatabaseModified notification,
 * so any UI components listening for changes will see this object as updated, and can update as appropriate.
 *
 * The touchObjectForKey:inCollection: method is similar to calling setObject:forKey:inCollection:withMetadata:,
 * and passing the object & metadata that already exists for the key. But without the overhead of fetching the items,
 * or re-writing the items to disk.
 *
 * The touchMetadataForKey: method is similar to calling setMetadata:forKey:,
 * and passing the metadata that already exists for the key. But without the overhead of fetching the metadata,
 * or re-writing the metadata to disk.
