/**
 * YapCache implements a simple strict cache.
 *
 * It is very similar to NSCache and shares a similar API.
 * However, YapCache implements a strict countLimit and monitors usage so eviction is properly ordered.
 *
 * For example:
 * If you set a countLimit of 4, then when you add the 5th item to the cache, another item is automatically evicted.
 * It doesn't happen at a later time as with NSCache. It happens atomically during the addition of the 5th item.
 
 * Which item gets evicted? That depends entirely on usage.
 * YapCache maintains a doubly linked-list of keys ordered by access.
 * The most recently accessed key is at the front of the linked-list,
 * and the least recently accessed key is at the back.
 * So it's very quick and efficient to evict items based on recent usage.
 *
 * YapCache is NOT thread-safe.
 * It is designed to be used by the various YapDatabase classes, which inherently serialize access to the cache.
