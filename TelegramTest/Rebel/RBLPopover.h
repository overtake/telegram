// Defines the different types of behavior of a RBLPopover.
//
// RBLPopoverBehaviorApplicationDefined - The application decides when the
//                                        popover should open and close, by
//                                        doing so manually.
// RBLPopoverBehaviorTransient          - If there is a mouse down anywhere
//                                        other than in the popover the popover
//                                        is closed. It is also closed if the
//                                        app or parent window lose focus or
//                                        `esc` is pressed.
// RBLPopoverBehaviorSemiTransient      - Closes the popover only if there is a
//                                        mouse up within the popover's parent
//                                        window or `esc` is pressed.

// A popover.
// This aims to replicate the API of `NSPopover`, within reason, whilst offering
// more flexibility when it comes to customising of its appearance.
//
// One notable difference in behaviour when compared to `NSPopover` is memory
// management. `RBLPopover` does not retain itself and when it deallocates it
// will be removed from screen. Therefore a reference must be kept to the popover
// (or it should be otherwise retained) for as long as it should appear on
// screen.
//
// A note on layers: by default the clipping method which the popover uses to
// clip its subviews to its outline does _not_ support any layer backed or
// hosting views. This can be worked around by adding mask layers to any layers
// you add to the popover or its subviews.
